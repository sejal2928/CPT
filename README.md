## Overview

The Hospital Management System is a theoretical project designed to simulate a simplified system for managing patient records and appointments within a healthcare facility.

## Features

- *Patient Registration*: Allows for the recording of patient information including ID, name, date of birth, gender, contact details, and address.

- *Appointment Scheduling*: Enables the scheduling of patient appointments with specific doctors.

- *Data Persistence*: Patient and appointment data is stored in a CSV file for future retrieval.
